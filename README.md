# OpenSim Unix Grid Manager

Set of scripts and configuration for **OpenSim** 0.9.x to manage one **Robust** and all **OpenSim** instances in a centralized way. Using a unique entry point with **screen** and factorized initialization files, it becomes easier to create and upgrate a grid, and manage running simulators.

## Understanding directories

All the configuration is in the `conf` directory and OpenSim provided initialization files are never touched. In fact the whole **Opensim** installation directory can be marked read-only to be sure it is not touched, and ready for an update.

OSGUM provided configuration files are in `lib/conf` directory, and should not be touched as well. Your configuration files are only in the `conf` directory to overload global settings.

Files created while instances are running are all in the `run` directory. One directory per **OpenSim** instance, plus the **Robust** one.

**OpenSim** downloaded binaries are in the `opensim` directory. It is possible to use difference versions of **OpenSim** for each instance and **Robust**, or use the same everywhere. It is very flexible :)

### Binaries

All commands are in the `bin` directory. The simpliest way to run your grid, once it is configured, is to run the `bin/gridctl` script, which starts **Robust** and all enabled **OpenSim** instances. **Robust** and **OpenSim** instances can also be controlled separately via `bin/robustctl` and `bin/simctl` respectively.

### Configuration

The main settings for the grid are stored in the `conf/osgum.conf` file. It's a bash script defining some variables used globally.
Other configuration files can be generated by the scripts.

#### conf/available/

This directory contains one directory per configured **OpenSim** instance.

#### conf/enabled/

This directory is a set of symlinks to the `conf/available/` directory for each enabled **OpenSim** instance. `bin/gridctl` will use those symlinks to know which instances to manage with the grid as a whole.

#### Local settings

OSUGM provides its own configuration files that should not be touched.
You can finegrain alter settings with those in the `conf` directory:

* `conf/osgum.conf` your OSGUM main configuration file
* `conf/Robust.ini` your local **Robust** settings
* `conf/Database.ini` your **Robust** database access settings
* `conf/Robust.exe.config` logging options
* `conf/OpenSim.ini` your local simulator settings, shared for all instances
* `conf/available/{inst}/instance.conf` local overrides from `conf/osgum.conf` (for example, to use a specific **OpenSim** version)
* `conf/available/{inst}/*.ini` your local simulator settings for a specific instance (all ini files in this directory are parsed)
* `conf/available/{inst}/OpenSim.exe.config` logging options
* `conf/available/{inst}/regions/*.ini` region initialization files

#### Global settings

Among files you should never touch, here is a description to have a quick sight on how things are organized.

For **Robust**:
* `lib/conf/Robust.ini` main configuration file, includes your `conf/Robust.ini` and `conf/Database.ini`
* `lib/conf/Robust.exe.config` used if `conf/Robust.exe.config` does not exist

For **OpenSim**:
* `lib/conf/OpenSim.ini` main configuration file for all instances
* `lib/conf/OpenSim.exe.config` used if `conf/available/{inst}/OpenSim.exe.config` does not exist

### Runtime directory

The `run` directory contains all *variable* files and directories. It's organized per instance:
* `run/grid` contains **Robust** runtime files
* `run/opensim.{instance}` (with *{instance}* the instane name) contains all **OpenSim** runtime files for one instance

## Quick start

Distribution is made of 2 classic directories:
* `bin` contains runnable scripts
* `lib` content needed by scripts

Other directories are generated during the setup. By default, **OSUGM** is configured to be in its own directory, using it as a root for user files. By exporting some variables it's possible to give it references to other directories:
* `OSUGM_CONF` where your configuration is
* `OSUGM_LIB` a different directory for **OSUGM** support files (for example to use it in a standard Unix way)
* `OSUGM_EXEC` where Opensim releases are put
* `OSUGM_RUN` runtime directory (your grid/opensim user files)

### Setup your grid

```sh
bin/gridctl init
```
That will generate the basic set of directories and files neeed by **OSUGM** (you can change them, see above).
* `conf/` your configuration directory
* `conf/osugm.conf` the central configuration file
* `conf/Database.ini` your Robust database access
* `conf/Robust.ini` almost empty file for overriding Robust settings
* `opensim/` where you put your OpenSim distributions
* `run/` all files generated by Robust, OpenSim and **OSUGM** itself (log files for instance)
