# OpenSim Unix Grid Manager

Set of scripts and configuration for **OpenSim** 0.9.x to manage one **Robust** and all **OpenSim** instances in a centralized way. Using a unique entry point with **screen** and factorized initialization files, it becomes easier to create and upgrate a grid, and manage running simulators.

## Understanding directories

All the configuration is in the `conf` directory and OpenSim provided initialization files are never touched. In fact the whole **Opensim** installation directory can be marked read-only to be sure it is not touched, and ready for an update.

OSGUM provided configuration files are in `lib/conf` directory, and should not be touched as well. Your configuration files are only in the `conf` directory to overload global settings.

Files created while instances are running are all in the `run` directory. One directory per **OpenSim** instance, plus the **Robust** one.

**OpenSim** downloaded binaries are in the `opensim` directory. It is possible to use difference versions of **OpenSim** for each instance and **Robust**, or use the same everywhere. It is very flexible :)

### Binaries

All commands are in the `bin` directory. The simpliest way to run your grid, once it is configured, is to run the `bin/gridctl` script, which starts **Robust** and all enabled **OpenSim** instances. **Robust** and **OpenSim** instances can also be controlled separately via `bin/robustctl` and `bin/simctl` respectively.

### Configuration

The main settings for the grid are stored in the `conf/osgum.conf` file. It's a bash script defining some variables used globally.
Other configuration files can be generated by the scripts.

#### conf/available/

This directory contains one directory per configured **OpenSim** instance.

#### conf/enabled/

This directory is a set of symlinks to the `conf/available/` directory for each enabled **OpenSim** instance. `bin/gridctl` will use those symlinks to know which instances to manage with the grid as a whole.

#### Local settings

OSUGM provides its own configuration files that should not be touched.
You can finegrain alter settings with those in the `conf` directory:

* `conf/osgum.conf` your OSGUM main configuration file
* `conf/Robust.ini` your local **Robust** settings
* `conf/Database.ini` your **Robust** database access settings
* `conf/Robust.exe.config` logging options
* `conf/OpenSim.ini` your local simulator settings, shared for all instances
* `conf/available/{inst}/instance.conf` local overrides from `conf/osgum.conf` (for example, to use a specific **OpenSim** version)
* `conf/available/{inst}/*.ini` your local simulator settings for a specific instance (all ini files in this directory are parsed)
* `conf/available/{inst}/OpenSim.exe.config` logging options
* `conf/available/{inst}/regions/*.ini` region initialization files

#### Global settings

Among files you should never touch, here is a description to have a quick sight on how things are organized.

For **Robust**:
* `lib/conf/Robust.ini` main configuration file, includes your `conf/Robust.ini` and `conf/Database.ini`
* `lib/conf/Robust.exe.config` used if `conf/Robust.exe.config` does not exist

For **OpenSim**:
* `lib/conf/OpenSim.ini` main configuration file for all instances
* `lib/conf/OpenSim.exe.config` used if `conf/available/{inst}/OpenSim.exe.config` does not exist

### Runtime directory

The `run` directory contains all *variable* files and directories. It's organized per instance:
* `run/grid` contains **Robust** runtime files
* `run/opensim.{instance}` (with *{instance}* the instane name) contains all **OpenSim** runtime files for one instance

## Usage explained

Distribution is made of 2 classic directories:
* `bin` contains runnable scripts
* `lib` content needed by scripts

Other directories are generated during the setup. By default, **OSUGM** is configured to be in its own directory, using it as a root for user files. By exporting some variables it's possible to give it references to other directories:
* `OSUGM_CONF` where your configuration is
* `OSUGM_LIB` a different directory for **OSUGM** support files (for example to use it in a standard Unix way)
* `OSUGM_EXEC` where Opensim releases are put
* `OSUGM_RUN` runtime directory (your grid/opensim user files)

### Setup OSUGM

```sh
bin/gridctl init
```
That will generate the basic set of directories and files neeed by **OSUGM** (you can change them, see above).
* `conf/` your configuration directory
* `conf/osugm.conf` the central configuration file
* `conf/Database.ini` your Robust database access
* `conf/Robust.ini` almost empty file for overriding Robust settings
* `opensim/` where you put your OpenSim distributions
* `run/` all files generated by Robust, OpenSim and **OSUGM** itself (log files for instance)

### Download and extract Opensim

You need of course at least one distribution of OpenSim available in the `opensim` directory (or any other directory if you changed `$OSUGM_EXEC`). Download the one you need, extract it in the `opensim` directory, ensuring the distribution respects the standard Opensim schema (everything contained in a `bin` directory).

```sh
$ cd path/to/osugm
$ cd opensim
$ tar -axf path/to/downloaded/opensim-0.9.2.0.tar.xz
$ ls opensim-0.9.2.0
addon-modules
bin
doc
...
```

### Configure your grid

Edit `conf/osugm.conf`. This is a **bash** shell script exporting a few variables:
* **OSUGM_LOGGING** if `true`, will log every command executed by **OSUGM** scripts in log files named after the script (`gridctl.log`, `robustctl.log`, `simctl.{instname}.log`)
* **OSUGM_NAME** is the main nickname of your grid. It should not contain any space or special character
* **OSUGM_FULLNAME** is the display name of your grid. By default it equals `$OSUGM_NAME`
* **OSUGM_HOST** is the hostname of the machine running the grid. Note that it **must be publicly accessible** from internet DNS servers. If you don't have a public hostname (with your own domain name, or some dynamic DNS), then you **MUST** put your **public IP address** there
* **OSUGM_SCHEME** should be left to `http` for now. It's in prevision for the future, when TLS will have been tested correctly.
* **OSUGM_PUBLICPORT** is the public port of your grid, that is, an opened port for internet on TCP. This, with **OSUGM_HOST**, is used to connect to your grid.
* **OSUGM_PRIVATEPORT** is the internal port of your grid, used by Opensim instances to reach grid services. If you plan to have Opensim instances outside of your local network, this port should also be opened for internet on TCP.
* **OSUGM_MONO** defaults to the system wide Mono executable. If you want to run with a specific version, you can specify its path here
* **OSUGM_OPENSIM** is the default Opensim distribution used. Set here the name of the directory created on Opensim distribution extraction. It will be used by Robust and all instances of OpenSim by default, but can be overridden when needed.
* **Other shell exports** can be set to adapt to your environment. Some are already set by default, you can change or comment them out as you need

### Database

Robust needs a MySQL database (or compatible, like MariaDB). **OSUGM** does not handle setting up a database for you, so refer to your GNU/Linux distribution for that. You must ensure one MySQL user exists and has full rights to one database.

You can then edit `conf/Database.ini`. The generated one uses `opensim` for the *user* and the *database name*. Along the *hostname* and *password*, set those to your local setup.

### Run Robust

You can now make a first startup of your grid service
```sh
$ bin/robustctl start
info Robust starting . running
```

As **OSUGM** uses *screen* to execute programs, Robust is started in the background. You can go to its console at anytime with
```sh
$ bin/robustctl console
```
Once there, you can do `Ctrl+D` to detach from this screen console (take time to get familiar with screen if you don't know it yet).

To stop the grid, and hence Robust
```sh
$ bin/robustctl stop
Robust stopping. stopped
```

### Configure your first simulator

The process is similar to the grid setup:
1. initialize default configuration and runtime files
2. edit configuration
3. run OpenSim

To generate default configuration files, you must first decide of an instance name for your simulator. **OSUGM** can manage several instances of OpenSim running on the same machine. You can for example call it `default` or `welcome`, or with a numeral scheme like `01`, `02`, etc.. We will use `instname` for illustration here.

```sh
$ bin/simctl init default
```
This generates several files in `conf/available/instname/`. The first one is `instance.conf`, and is the equivalent to `osugm.conf`, dedicated to this instance of OpenSim.

You can for example change shell and Mono settings, and override some global variables, like `$OSUGM_OPENSIM` to use a specific OpenSim distribution.

The most important variable to setup is `OSUGM_SIMPORT`. It represents the HTTP port used by OpenSim to listen on (for various services like LSL HTTP servers). It will be used to set the `http_listener_port` of the `[Network]` section of OpenSim configuration.

You also have a `Local.ini` which is empty by default, but will be included for OpenSim after all others. You can put your custom settings there. In fact, you can add as many `.ini` files as you want, they will all be read.

An additional and important generated file is `conf/OpenSim.ini`. This is one you can customize and is read by all instances of OpenSim, making shared configuration easier. By default, it sets up the simulator database connector (a simple SQLite database in the runtime directory).

`Regions.ini` files will be stored in `conf/available/instname/regions/` when you will create your first region in OpenSim. Talking about that, let's do it!

```sh
$ bin/simctl start instname
info instname starting . running
```

Like for Robust, you can get to the console with
```sh
$ bin/simctl console instname
```
You should there see the OpenSim prompt to create a region. Refer to OpenSim documentation for this. Just be sure:
* to use a DNS hostname publicly accessible from internet for the *External Hostname*, or the public IP if a DNS is not possible
* set an *Internal Port* that is opened for UDP on incoming requests

A last step: your grid needs a default region. So in `conf/Robust.ini` change the commented line to match your region name:
```ini
[GridService]

    Region_Welcome = "DefaultRegion, FallbackRegion"
```
